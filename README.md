Project Library Management System

OBJECTIVE
The objective of a Library Management System (LMS) is to efficiently manage and automate the libraryâ€™s operations, including cataloging resources, managing user accounts, handling transactions, and generating reports. It aims to streamline processes, improve accessibility for users, and enhance overall library efficiency.

KEY ACTIVTIES
The key activities of a Library Management System include:

Cataloging: Organizing and managing books, journals, and other materials in a searchable database.
User Management: Handling member registration, profiles, borrowing limits, and privileges.
Circulation: Managing check-ins, checkouts, renewals, and reservations of library materials.
Acquisition: Tracking the procurement of new materials, including purchases and donations.
Inventory Management: Monitoring the availability and condition of library resources.
Fine Management: Handling late returns, fines, and fee collection.
Reporting: Generating reports on user activity, inventory, and system performance.
Digital Resources: Managing access to e-books, journals, and other digital materials.

 TECHNOLOGIES USED 
  in an SQL-based Library Management System, the following technologies are used:

SQL Database: For storing and managing library data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
Tables: To organize data into entities like Books, Users, Loans, Authors, and Fines.
SQL Queries: For operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE to manage records.
Joins: To retrieve related data from multiple tables (e.g., joining Books and Loans tables).
Indexes: For improving search performance on large data sets.
Stored Procedures: For automating repetitive tasks like issuing or returning books.
Triggers: For automatically enforcing rules or conditions (e.g., updating availability on book return).
Backup and Recovery: To protect the database from data loss and ensure smooth operations.
