KEY ACTIVTIES

Key activities of student database management in SQL include:

Creating Tables: Defining tables for students, courses, and enrollments.
Inserting Data: Adding student, course, and grade records into the database.
Updating Records: Modifying existing data, such as student details or grades.
Querying Data: Using SELECT statements to retrieve specific information.
Joining Tables: Combining data from multiple tables for comprehensive reports.
Managing Integrity: Using constraints (e.g., foreign keys) to ensure data accuracy.
Optimizing Performance: Using indexes and efficient queries for faster access.

 TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 Technologies used in student database management with SQL include:

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS): MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle for managing structured student data.
SQL Queries: Used for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting student records.
SQL Joins: Combining data from multiple tables (e.g., students, courses, grades).
Stored Procedures: Predefined SQL code for performing repetitive tasks.
Triggers: Automatic SQL actions based on certain database events (e.g., record updates).
Indexes: Enhancing query performance for large datasets.
